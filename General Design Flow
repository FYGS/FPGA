General Design Flow
I. Vivado

Open Vivado and select Zedboard
Create an new Vivado Project
Create empty block design workspace inside the new project
Add required IP blocks using the IP integrator tool and build Hardware Design
Validate and save block design
Create HDL system wrapper
Run design Synthesis and Implementation
Generate Bit File
Export Hardware Design including the generated bit stream file to SDK tool
Launch SDK
Now the Hardware design is exported to the SDK tool. The Vivado to SDK hand-off is done internally through Vivado. We will use SDK to create a Software application that will use the customized board interface data and FPGA hardware configuration by importing the hardware design information from Vivado.

II. SDK

Create new application project and select default Hello World template
Program FPGA and run application
